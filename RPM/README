HOWTO GENERATE RPM FILE
-----------------------

1) Edit netmap.spec! Increase at least revision number, but also add
 something useful to the %changelog section.

2) $ rpmbuild -ba RPM/netmap.spec
 This (default) directory for your RPM builds may have been changed in
 ~/.rpmbuild (parameter %_topdir). Another favourite location is
 /usr/src/redhat/.

3) Find result in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS

4) Upload eventually to Distribution list on ShPt:
 $ cd $rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/
 $ ~/Astro/CTA/WWW/ShPt/Curl/uploadPortalDoc \
  /WG/ACTL/SiteAssets/SitePages/CameraServerSetup/netmap-0.1-2.x86_64.rpm
