HOWTO GENERATE RPM FILE
-----------------------

1) Edit netmap.spec! Increase at least revision number, but also add
 something useful to the %changelog section.

2) Commit the changes. The RPM build will clone a fresh copy from git.

3) $ rpmbuild -ba RPM/netmap.spec
 This (default) directory for your RPM builds may have been changed in
 ~/.rpmbuild (parameter %_topdir). Another favourite location is
 /usr/src/redhat/.

3) Find result in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS and upload to repository
 $ cd $rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/
 $ ls -l
 $ cp *.rpm $REPODIR/x86_64
